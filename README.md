We described a novel method based on logistic regression predictive model analysis to 
predict the third ventricle size of the normal adult brain of Ghanaians. 
The systematic procedure involved in the accurate predictive analysis include data collection, 
data exploration; done to visualize the available datasets, data cleaning or wrangling; done to remove redundancies and check for missing values
from data, data training; done to split data into training and testing datasets, logistic regression model; a predictive model in which dependent 
and the independent variable is fed, Prediction and testing of the model generated as well as an accuracy check.
